Climate change is terrifying. It is no wonder some people would prefer to live in ignorance rather than acknowledge the volatile nature of our survival here on Earth. But pretty soon, this self-made apocalypse’s deadly, destructive, and planet-breaking effects will become evident. We already know about the catastrophic extreme weather, vast droughts, ranging wildfires, sea level rises, fatal heatwaves, collapsing ecosystems and social distress that climate change will cause. But a recent study has just added a whole new disastrous consequence of our climate crimes: more volcanic eruptions. So what is the mechanism at work here? And how will this affect our climate predictions from now on?

This study in the Bulletin of Volcanology looked at a vast amount of data relating to the quantity of rainfall on 1,200 volcanoes and how often they erupted. As volcanoes can take hundreds, if not thousands, of years between eruptions, this data wasn’t gathered directly. Instead, the scientists looked at evidence of historical rainfall in sediments, allowing them to understand what was happening to these volcanoes from the present all the way back to 11,700 years ago. What they found was intriguing because the more it rained, the higher the chance these volcanoes erupted.

This may seem odd, as nothing as inconsequential as rain should matter to something as elemental and powerful as a volcano. But in reality, rainfall can profoundly impact these powerful geological structures in two ways: dome destabilisation and ground penetration.

Firstly, dome destabilisation. One of the things which keeps volcanoes from erupting is the weight and integrity of the sediments left on top of them from the previous eruption, also known as the dome. These volcanic ash sediments can lock together and put tremendous weight on the crater and surrounding structure, which has the effect of plugging the volcano, meaning it will take more force for magma to exit from the chambers and therefore make eruptions rarer.
